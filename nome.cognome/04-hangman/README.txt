Game mechanics:

1- You will find the words in the Hang.words array
2- there can be more than one word, so you should pick one randomly.
3- the word will replace all letters of the original word by "_"
4- the user will insert letter by letter a guess
5- if the guess is correct, all occurence of that letter, in the original word, will be displayed
6- if the guess is incorrect, the hangman will advance to the next stage (see /img)
7- the game finishes when the user guess correctly all the letters or when the hangman reaches the last stage.
